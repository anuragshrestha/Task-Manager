# Welcom to the Task-Manager App

A cross platform mobile application that helps us to easily manage our day to day tasks by adding the task, editing and deleting it when ever we want. It also has a fetaure of marking the task as comppleted and not compeleted. We can see the `top 10` people who has completed most of the task in the leader board. 

This mobile application has a unique features. `When a new user account is cretaed and then the user signout and signin back then it gives a welcome message to 
the user`. When we logout from the app, it sucessfully logs out and opens the sign-in screen but gives us a permission denied error which can be ignored for now.

## Note: `I have already created some dummy accounts and added task for each of the users and marked it as comppleted`

## Stack Used for the project:
`FrontEnd`: ReactNative, TypeScript
`BackEnd`: FireBase Authentication, Firestore Database.



# Getting Started

## Set up :
 Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding. This docs, has all the required steps to set up both the simulator and devices.



## Step 1: Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/anuragshrestha/Task-Manager.git



## Step 2: Go to the project directory
cd TaskManager && 
npm install


## Step 3: Start the Metro Server

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start


## Step 4: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:


### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios



### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android




If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.
